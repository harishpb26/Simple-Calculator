# Simple-Calculator

> Here is a PLY implementation of a calculator with variables

# Introduction

 It's implemented entirely in Python.
 PLY uses LR-parsing which is reasonably efficient and well suited for larger grammars.

# How to Use

# Requirements

PLY requires the use of Python 2.6 or greater. However, you should use the latest Python release if possible. It should work on just about any platform.
